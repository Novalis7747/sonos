summary = "Sonos addOn for Sonos Desktop V1.3"
description = """This is for Sonos Desktop 9.2 and higher, although this program is pretty accessible by default, NVDA can't read the currently playing station and song title. This addOn gives you 3 hotkeys to get that information. - control-1 - speaks current roomname, stationname and title of the song - double press alt-1 - copies song title to the clipboard - control-2 - opens the song title in a virtual invisible window to read it back - control-3 - opens Youtube in your default browser with the results for currently playing song (opens in a new tab). It also makes the shortCuts window accessible and you can read the shortCuts as a normal listview."""
