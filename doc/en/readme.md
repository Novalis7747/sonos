* Author: Ralf Kefferpuetz

This is for Sonos Desktop 9.2 and higher, although this program is pretty accessible by default, NVDA can't read the currently playing station and song title. This addOn gives you 3 hotkeys to get this information. 
- control-1 - speaks current roomname, stationname and title of the song 
- double press control-1 - copies song title to the clipboard 
- control-2 - opens the song title in a virtual invisible window to read it back 
- control-3 - opens Youtube in your default browser with the search results for currently playing song (opens in a new tab)
- alt-shift-v  - reports current volume
- alt-shift-m  - reports mute status
- control-m - toggles mute
- alt-shift-r  - reports repeat status
- control-r - toggles repeat
- alt-shift-e  - reports shuffle status
- control-e - toggles shuffle
- alt-shift-t  - reports crossfade status
- control-t - toggles crossfade
- alt-shift-u  - reports time playing
- alt-shift-i  - reports scrub
- alt-shift-o  - reports play time left
- It also makes the shortCuts-keys window accessible and you can read the shortCuts as a normal listview.
