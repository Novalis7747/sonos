* Author: Ralf Kefferpuetz

This is for Sonos Desktop, although this program is pretty accessible by default, NVDA can't read the currently playing station and song title. This addOn gives you 3 hotkeys to get this information. 
- control-1 - speaks current roomname, stationname and title of the song 
- double press control-1 - copies song title to the clipboard 
- control-2 - opens the song title in a virtual invisible window to read it back 
- control-3 - opens Youtube in your default browser with the search results for currently playing song (opens in a new tab)
