<p>This is for Sonos Desktop 9.2 and higher, although this program is pretty accessible by default, NVDA can't read the currently playing station and song title. This addOn gives you 3 hotkeys to get this information. </p>
<p>- control-1 - speaks current roomname, stationname and title of the song </p>
<p>- double press control-1 - copies song title to the clipboard </p>
<p>- control-2 - opens the song title in a virtual invisible window to read it back </p>
<p>- control-3 - opens Youtube in your default browser with the search results for currently playing song (opens in a new tab)</p>
- It also makes the shortCuts keys window accessible and you can read the shortCuts as a normal listview.
